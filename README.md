### Project Title
**Bikeshare Data Analysis**

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

Trip history data were obtained from the following websites:
